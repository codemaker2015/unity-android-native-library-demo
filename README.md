# Unity Android Native Library Demo

This project is covering the Android platform and creating a native Unity3D plugin for that platform. It will cover the creation an .AAR file.

The AAR file type is primarily associated with ‘Axis Archive’ by Apache Software Foundation. Compressed file package for Apache Axis 2 which contains classes and data for a Web Service. The AAR is a JAR (Java Archive) file and is therefore based on the standard ZIP file format.

Now that we have that covered, let’s start creating our native plugin.

## Toolset

* Android Studio Editor software
* An Android device to test/compile
* Unity editor
